> Attentive Generative Adversarial Network for Raindrop Removal from A Single Image (CVPR'2018)

https://github.com/rui1996/DeRaindrop (dataset publically available)

Image pairs where each pair contains exactly the same background scene, yet one is degraded by raindrops and the other one is free from raindrops. Contains 1119 pairs of images (861 image pairs for training and 239 image pairs for testing), with various background scenes and raindrops. Sony A6000 and Canon EOS 60 for the image acquisition.

> Restoring an Image Taken through a Window Covered with Dirt or Rain (ICCV'2013)

http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_iccv_2013/papers/Eigen_Restoring_an_Image_2013_ICCV_paper.pdf

Built by taking photographs of multiple scenes with and without the corruption present. For corrupt images, we simulated the effect of rain on a window by spraying water on a pane of anti-reflective MgF2-coated glass, taking care to produce drops that closely resemble real rain. To limit motion differences between clean and rainy shots, all scenes contained only static objects.
